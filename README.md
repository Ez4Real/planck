## BACKEND

### Configure

You can then update configs in the `.env` files to customize your configurations.

Before deploying it, make sure you change at least the values for:

- `SECRET_KEY`
- `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

You can (and should) pass these as environment variables from secrets.

Read the [deployment.md](./deployment.md) docs for more details.

### Generate Secret Keys

Some environment variables in the `.env` file have a default value of `changethis`.

You have to change them with a secret key, to generate secret keys you can run the following command:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Copy the content and use that as password / secret key. And run that again to generate another secure key.

### General Workflow

By default, the dependencies are managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), go there and install it.

From `./backend/` you can install all the dependencies with:

```console
$ uv sync
```

Then you can activate the virtual environment with:

```console
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```
Make sure your editor is using the correct Python virtual environment, with the interpreter at `backend/.venv/bin/python`.

Modify or add SQLModel models for data and SQL tables in `./backend/app/models.py`, API endpoints in `./backend/app/api/`, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) utils in `./backend/app/crud.py`.

## Backend tests

To test the backend run:

```console
$ bash ./scripts/test.sh
```

The tests run with Pytest, modify and add tests to `./backend/app/tests/`.

If you use GitHub Actions the tests will run automatically.

## Test running stack

If your stack is already up and you just want to run the tests, you can use:

```bash
docker compose exec backend bash scripts/tests-start.sh
```

That `/app/scripts/tests-start.sh` script just calls `pytest` after making sure that the rest of the stack is running. If you need to pass extra arguments to `pytest`, you can pass them to that command and they will be forwarded.

For example, to stop on first error:

```bash
docker compose exec backend bash scripts/tests-start.sh -x
```


## Migrations

As during local development your app directory is mounted as a volume inside the container, you can also run the migrations with `alembic` commands inside the container and the migration code will be in your app directory (instead of being only inside the container). So you can add it to your git repository.

Make sure you create a "revision" of your models and that you "upgrade" your database with that revision every time you change them. As this is what will update the tables in your database. Otherwise, your application will have errors.

* Alembic is already configured to import your SQLModel models from `./backend/app/models.py`.

* After changing a model (for example, adding a column), inside the container, create a revision, e.g.:

```console
$ alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add column last_name to User model"
```

* Commit to the git repository the files generated in the alembic directory.

* After creating the revision, run the migration in the database (this is what will actually change the database):

```console
$ alembic upgrade head
```

If you don't want to use migrations at all, uncomment the lines in the file at `./backend/app/core/db.py` that end in:

```python
SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

and comment the line in the file `scripts/prestart.sh` that contains:

```console
$ alembic upgrade head
```

If you don't want to start with the default models and want to remove them / modify them, from the beginning, without having any previous revision, you can remove the revision files (`.py` Python files) under `./backend/app/alembic/versions/`. And then create a first migration as described above.

## Email Templates (if present)

The email templates are in `./backend/app/email-templates/`. Here, there are two directories: `build` and `src`. The `src` directory contains the source files that are used to build the final email templates. The `build` directory contains the final email templates that are used by the application.

Before continuing, ensure you have the [MJML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=attilabuti.vscode-mjml) installed in your VS Code.

Once you have the MJML extension installed, you can create a new email template in the `src` directory. After creating the new email template and with the `.mjml` file open in your editor, open the command palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for `MJML: Export to HTML`. This will convert the `.mjml` file to a `.html` file and now you can save it in the build directory.

### FRONTEND 

## Install Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure that you have either the Node Version Manager (nvm) or Fast Node Manager (fnm) installed on your system.

* To install fnm follow the [official fnm guide](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#installation). If you prefer nvm, you can install it using the [official nvm guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

* After installing either nvm or fnm, proceed to the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```
* If the Node.js version specified in the `.nvmrc` file isn't installed on your system, you can install it using the appropriate command:

```bash
# If using fnm
fnm install

# If using nvm
nvm install
```

* Once the installation is complete, switch to the installed version:

```bash
# If using fnm
fnm use

# If using nvm
nvm use
```

* Within the `frontend` directory, install the necessary NPM packages:

```bash
npm install
```

* And start the live server with the following `npm` script:

```bash
npm run dev
```

* Then open your browser at http://localhost:5173/.

Notice that this live server is not running inside Docker, it's for local development, and that is the recommended workflow. Once you are happy with your frontend, you can build the frontend Docker image and start it, to test it in a production-like environment. But building the image at every change will not be as productive as running the local development server with live reload.

Check the file `package.json` to see other available options.

## Generate Client

### Automatically

* Activate the backend virtual environment.
* From the top level project directory, run the script:

```bash
./scripts/generate-client.sh
```

* Commit the changes.

### Manually

* Start the Docker Compose stack.

* Download the OpenAPI JSON file from `http://localhost/api/v1/openapi.json` and copy it to a new file `openapi.json` at the root of the `frontend` directory.

* To generate the frontend client, run:

```bash
npm run generate-client
```

* Commit the changes.

Notice that everytime the backend changes (changing the OpenAPI schema), you should follow these steps again to update the frontend client.

## Using a Remote API

If you want to use a remote API, you can set the environment variable `VITE_API_URL` to the URL of the remote API. For example, you can set it in the `frontend/.env` file:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://api.my-domain.example.com
```

Then, when you run the frontend, it will use that URL as the base URL for the API.

## Code Structure

The frontend code is structured as follows:

* `frontend/src` - The main frontend code.
* `frontend/src/assets` - Static assets.
* `frontend/src/client` - The generated OpenAPI client.
* `frontend/src/components` -  The different components of the frontend.
* `frontend/src/hooks` - Custom hooks.
* `frontend/src/routes` - The different routes of the frontend which include the pages.
* `theme.tsx` - The Chakra UI custom theme.
